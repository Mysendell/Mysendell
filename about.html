        <p>Here we'll have a little bit about Kleber.</p>
        <p>He's a (at the moment of writing, in 2025) high school student
            at Cefet-MG, a technical school in Brazil.
            Though he has always been interested in programming, he only
            started seriously studying it in 2023, when he started the technical course.
            To him programming is a way to create and solve problems, and he's always
            looking for new ways to learn and improve his skills.
